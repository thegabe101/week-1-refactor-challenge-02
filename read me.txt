This was a code refactoring assignment seeking to increase semantic intelligibility and increase CSS efficiency.

- The motivation for this assignment was practicing code refactoring and learning how to identify and eliminate unecessary CSS code. 
- I worked on this in order to learn what sort of work refactoring requires.
- This project solves issues with extraneous code and a lack of semantic clarity in the original html. It also solves a minor issue with the navbar and uses article ids in order to declutter. 
- I learned how important semantic tags are and how to avoid using an unecessarily large css packet.
